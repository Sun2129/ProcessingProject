# ProcessingProject
A processing project in which a .csv data file, which details the weather of a specific city over multiple years, is read from and manipulated.

The program is able to display the minimum temperatures, maximum temperatures, or both in a GUI window. Certain months can be selected to view the 
temperatures of the said month, or all of the data can be viewed at the same time. The program also allows for the use of a bar chart or scatter plot.

This program demonstrates the use of File I/O and GUI interfaces.
